This week's topic encouraged me to study Agile methodologies and question my own agility, both as a person and as a UX designer. In the best traditions of critical reflection, demanding the practitioner to question the way their perceptions and beliefs have changed over time (Fook 2007), I started asking myself:

- Am I personally agile enough? Are my plans too rigid?
- How has my perception of Agile changed since September, when I started exploring the studies?
- How has my practice changed? How can I apply my newly acquired knowledge to improve my team's work? 

### Personal Agility

After a careful consideration, I have concluded that my personal approach to planning activities and deliverables has changed quite positively.

I stopped planning my **weekly activities** and focused on setting **achievable goals**: considering how closely my life resembles the Complex Domain (Rubin 2012), it makes sense to move carefully, explore, inspect, and learn.

I started practising critical reflection, looking back upon my experience and in the moment. I keep a private diary to make sure I take notes along the way and have a chance to return to it when needed. 

I am meeting my SMART goals: being more active in the community, make friends, participate in discussions. I recently **joined a new Design Community**, and established a little community at work.

### The Change in Perception

I was taught to wrap the discovery process with an alignment on the Minimal Viable Product, although Minimal Lovable Product  (Merryweather 2020) resonates better, despite a rather subtle difference between the two. I would love to be able to focus on delivering a Lovable product for my upcoming projects, and deliver a highly desirable product with minimal functionality instead of rigidly following the plan. 

It is more important for me to understand that the plan should serve as a roadmap rather than a strict rules book: we are not working towards delivering the plan, we're working towards managing in change (Waldock ca. 2020). 

Working on the rapid ideations, especially on the [[2021-11-14 Rapid Ideation Project — Game for Humanity|second project]], I seem to have overcomplicated the concept and violated the core principle of delivering the MVP — simplicity:

> If you can't explain the vision in one paragraph, you don't understand the product
(Parker ca. 2020)

For the upcoming sessions and projects, I should focus on aligning on an MVP instead of attempting to think everything through — at the end of the day, ‘working solutions over comprehensive documentation’ (Beck 2001).

### The Change in Practice

If I were to plan out my delivery for [[2021-10-24 Rapid Ideation Project — Flying Taxis|the first Rapid Ideation product]], it would be rather easy: I have outlined the scope for the MVP, defined the customers, and established a strong vision. 

For the [[2021-11-14 Rapid Ideation Project — Game for Humanity|second ideation]], more effort would be required due to the nature of the project (board game), the complexity of its mechanics, and my complete lack of experience.

I need to get more flexible, but make sure to incorporate my vision in the planning, and not only the definition of done for the user stories. I must make sure I complete my deliverables on time, as I do, but don't overestimate myself. To apply it to my studies:

- I will plan my activities for the next week on a Friday night, and reflect back on the previous week to identify my personal ‘velocity’ and not overestimate myself;
- I should reflect upon my reflection — start writing retro posts every 2 weeks, looking back and setting new SMART goals;
- I need to start seeing the big picture: not ‘I want to read a book by Aristotle’ but ‘I would love to discover what Aristotle's view on politics was’.

I need not to adopt agile, but adapt it for my needs and practices. Be like water.
