First, I wanted to thank LJ for pointing me in the right direction with the user interviews — I went back and facilitated a few more sessions to close the gaps and focus not only on what those in need of emotional support required, but also on what my users thought about supporting the others emotionally.

So, here is where my persona was born: I decided to follow Indi Young's advice and removed all demographics data (Young 2016), and instead focused on what my persona needed — the type of wants and aspirations my product could fulfill, the pain points I could relieve. I also recalled Jason Travis's advice (2015) and included some personal items to make my persona a bit more human. ‘Communicating the user experience’ also recommended to include Must Do's and Must Don'ts (Caddick and Cable 2011), so they also helped me enforce my persona quite well.

I then proceeded into creating a Task Map but quickly realised it didn't capture the complexity of the journey well enough: it lacked the human perspective, the emotional side of the experience. I think Wireflow would do a much better job here, helping me capture the experience and provide a good level of interactivity (Laubheimer 2016).

A User Journey helped me solve what persona expectedly couldn't — get a 3D perspective and put the priority on my user (Howard 2014). I included the actions my user takes, the thoughts she is having during and after the experience, and the opportunities that could help eliminate her biggest pain points and make her experience more pleasant.

Concurrently, I was busy analysing the three types of competitors — Journaling and self-help apps, Peer-support platforms, and Networking products. I used feature inventory to outline the feature most of the selected apps had in common. A little thing I noticed was that while some got certain aspects really well (Reflectly, for instance, provided an outstanding journaling experience), none of the competitors provided all key features at the same time (Therapeer, for instance, only focused on peer support, and Wisdo only had discussion clubs and mentorship programmes). I also outlined what those apps excelled at to help me learn from the best.

Completing the persona, UJ, and competitor analysis helped me understand what my platform is set to accomplish for the user, what my user needs, and how technology and design can help make their experience meaningful and pleasant. By combining self-help tools, such as reflections and journals, and peer-support I can create a product that will help those in need to process their experiences in a meaningful way, connect with those who can support them, and assist those in need.
