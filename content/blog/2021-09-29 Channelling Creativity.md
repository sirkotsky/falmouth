This week, I researched the ICEDIP and SCAMPER methods of enhancing and channelling creativity. 

ICEDIP method, created by Geofrey Petty, describes 6 stages of the creative process: from research and getting inspired to selecting the best idea. The stages are not linear and can be visited in any order, which allows for deeper exploration, and the students are often encourage to develop their own technique instead of following a pre–designed model. ICEDIP looks like a great pick for the situations when you are presented with the problem, and little to no solutions are yet available.

SCAMPER comprises 7 steps, and is also not providing a linear guidance: asking the right questions and challenging the existing idea, the facilitators are expected to get creative in any order they see fit. Can the presented solution be substituted? Is there any way it can be modified? Anything that the history can suggest? SCAMPER looks like a great tool when the solution is available (known) and needs to be challenged, changed, morphed into something else.

Creativity is a complex process, and channelling it the right way may seem like an impossible task. In his book "Unlocking creativity", Michael Roberto talks about taking breaks as an integral part of the creative process. Taking a step back to avoid "grinding" is a pathway to unlocking a more productive type of creativity, so every time I need to get more "creative", I take some time off to let my brain reset, and start over. I usually work in short cycles (25–5) to make sure I recharge and get enough rest to complete my tasks. This sounds a lot like ICEDIP's "incubation" step, when it's recommended to leave the work alone and get back it occasionally.

However, that does not always help — especially when the given challenge is complex enough and takes time to resolve. Every creative process is essentially fuelled by a comprehensive research, and ICEDIP suggests extensive research ("inspiration") as one of the essential steps to getting to find the right solution. I have unknowingly employed some techniques while working on the design projects: incubation and inspiration being one of them, but I feel like my creative thinking process currently lacks a more funnelled approach, when I assemble my ideas and "boil them down" into a single vision, instead of trying to achieve multiple goals at once.

SCAMPER, on the other hand, is the method I have not previously heard of. As a design thinking facilitator, I often come across the problems that might require some out–of–the–box thinking. Employing SCAMPER will definitely help as both a potential ice–breaker for DT workshops, and the main activity canvas for complex problems that require unusual solutions.
