That's been a rather bumpy ride, although I did manage to stay sane throughout the first module, and made it to almost every webinar (aside a few I overslept, it is a tad challenging to wake your tired body up at 3 in the morning). 

**What did you do well?**
I enjoyed the learning a lot, so planning the activities and allocating a few hours daily on reading, working on challenges, and posting in the forum wasn't as tough as I thought it would be. I think I did pretty well in terms of submitting my works and writing journal entries on time, and keeping the quality up as well. 

I also enjoy the fact that I've been using my journal to master React better, and now using its code to update my portfolio website. That went rather well.

**What did you learn?**
I think I managed to learn much more than I initially expected to. Starting from how to write critical reflective journal and process every experience in and on, to channelling creativity and turning creative power into a muscle, rather than expecting the inspiration to kick in. 

I discovered a few amazing titles: from ‘Essential Scrum’ and ‘Agile Foundations’ to ‘Unlocking Creativity’ and ‘The Design Thinking Playbook’: I even wrote my reviews on the latter two and got responses from the respective authors, which was unexpected and cool. 

From the practical standpoint, I picked up a few nice design tools (Framer, Excalidraw) and some great canvases (Opposite Thinking, SCAMPER). Most importantly, however, I learnt how to communicate better: I was quite shy and anxious to post blog entries and write comments before, but now it feels very natural. I (almost) overcame my anxiety and finally started blogging on a regular basis (not only on design-related topics). That's an important interpersonal milestone in my books.

 **What should you do differently in the next module?**
 To second Jesse's point: comment more frequently on others' posts, make sure to check the replies and respond on time. 
 
 I need to set up a clear way of tracking my SMART goals — a panel on the website might do just fine. I have not forgotten about the goals I set up miday (nor of any other goals I added to list on the way), but it might be helpful to see them more frequently and check whether I have achieved them.
 
**What still puzzles you?**
I still have a long way to go, and I think the previous week made me think a lot about my future perspectives and what I want to focus on. I think my priorities and aspirations puzzle me more than the module's structure or the CRJ requirements.


### Reviewing the SMART goals

A few weeks back, I set up a few SMART goals to help me become a better practitioner (and a better person). It is a good time I revisit the goals and review which of them I eventually managed to achieve.

**Goal 1**
I shall publish the forum entries and make sure to respond to at least 3 posts every week throughout the entire duration of my studies. This will help me communicate better with the people I barely get to talk to, and help make new connections.

==Partially accomplished==. I managed to respond to a few posts each week: however, some weeks, I only had a chance to post a single response. For the next module, I should be more active and monitor the amount of posts I make in the forum.

**Goal 2**
I shall implement a more flexible personal plan using Kanban with clear objectives and a roadmap, not bound by items in the to–do lists, but by achievable goals. I shall set up a planning board by the end of this sprint, and use it as a base for my personal learning planning.

==Accomplished==. I started using Kanban for personal planning, plan out the deliverables on Sunday, and running little retro sessions every two weeks, optimising the plan according to my ‘velocity’.

**Goal 3**
For the upcoming assignments of this module, I shall only use the software I am unfamiliar with. This way, I will manage to challenge myself, learn new things, master new techniques.

==Partially accomplished==. I completed my second rapid ideation using Open Source software (except final implementation). I keep challenging myself and want to continue doing so moving forward.

**Goal 4**
 I should be active in the community — join their daily and weekly discussions, leave at least 5 comments each week in their Discord chats, and participate in the webinars they host every month.
 
 ==Accomplished==. I made a few new connections via Discord, had plenty of amazing chats with the community members, and got much more active online that ever before. I would love to keep it up and be much more proactive in building a network of personal and professional connections.
