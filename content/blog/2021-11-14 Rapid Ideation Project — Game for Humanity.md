## Project discovery

Earlier this sprint, I kicked off the process by ideating the product that would help increase environmental awareness. 

I came up with an idea of a board game — tentatively titled *‘Game for Humanity’* — the goal of which would be to run the city, expand its limits, and help it prosper while striking a good balance between green and traditional economy.

## Delivery

### Working out the game's mechanics

I started working on the final prototype in a spreadsheet: apparently, the most common practice in board game development, as per many forums I have visited prior. It took a while to put together the necessary formulas and make sure the mechanics work just as expected — every card draw and year passing should have short- and long-term effects on the player and their city.

Having a mechanics in place, it was only a matter of crafting the high-fidelity prototype.

## Reflection
At the end of any Rapid Ideation session, this and the [[2021-10-24 Rapid Ideation Project — Flying Taxis|previous one]] are no exceptions, I love to look back at the progress and think about the things that went well, things that I could have done differently, and things that didn't go as planned.

### What went well
Overall, I am relatively happy with the outcome of this session, despite it going much less smooth than the previous rapid ideation.

I really **enjoyed putting together my first-ever board game** concept — it always looked much simpler on paper, but in practices, a somewhat complex game will takes months of hard work to deliver a comprehensive and fun product with well-balanced mechanics.

Using **FOSS** for the majority of my runway, except the final delivery, was rather interesting and fascinating. Some software products are, unfortunately, far from delivering a pleasant experience (PenPot felt raw and buggy), while the others will definitely remain in my toolbox for the upcoming projects (Raindrop is absolutely amazing, and so is Excalidraw).

I managed to **learn a lot about board games** in a short period of time, tried some out myself — from ‘Exploding Kittens’ to ‘Terraforming Mars’. I used to be a firm believed that board games in general were either too childish, too complex (D&D), or intentionally simple and fun (Cards Against Humanity) — I couldn't think there would be so many games that would serve as a great educational material in the market. I assume that is in like with how Fook and Gardner (2007) explain critical reflection from the post-modernistic perspective: challenging the existing assumptions, the perception of power, education, knowledge.

### What went wrong
From the get-go, my idea seemed a bit too ambitious for a short rapid ideation project, and I decided to tackle too many things: from it being educational and fun to delivering a rather complex mechanics of the game itself.

In a way, I failed to deliver on both: the game turned out to be rather basic, despite plenty of time spent on discovery and research, and it didn't turn out to be as complex as I hoped it would be. I cannot say I am not satisfied with the result, but I definitely could have simplified the initial concept, sacrificing some unnecessarily bloated ideas.

I also missed the opportunity to pick up another skill — for instance, 3D or graphic design. For the next sessions, I should be more clear with the goals I have in mind, including the skills I am willing to develop by the end of the session.

### What could have been improved
For this particular session, I didn't have a need to use version control tools — however, for the next session, I should set up a Bitbucket or a GitLab account (in accordance with my promise to not use familiar software for rapid ideation sessions), and make sure I track the changes accordingly.

I didn't quite stick to the FOSS until the very end, and I did run all the programmes in a proprietary OS — next time, I could this opportunity to get myself familiar with a different OS (ex-Ubuntu myself).
